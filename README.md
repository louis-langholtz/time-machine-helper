# Time Machine Helper

A Qt based GUI application for helping with macOS Time Machine.
This is a macOS specific application.

## Prerequisites

This project minimally needs the following:

- macOS 14 (or newer).
- C++20 (or higher).
- coroutine library support.

## Please Note

As of November 8, 2023, GitHub doesn't appear to have a runner available for macos-14 yet.
So, this project's continuous integration setup is disabled for now and shows up as failed.
